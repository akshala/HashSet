# HashSet - A Dataset For Hashtag Segmentation
Hashset is a new dataset consisiting on 1.9k manually annotated and 3.3M loosely supervised tweets for testing the efficiency of hashtag segmentation models. We compare State of The Art Hashtag Segmentation models on Hashset and other baseline datasets (STAN and BOUN). We compare and analyse the results across the datasets to argue that HashSet can act as a good benchmark for hashtag segmentation tasks.
